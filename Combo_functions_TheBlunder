#1. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:
|  Column  |   Type   |
|---------------------|
| ID       | Integer  |
| Name     | String   |
| Salary   | Integer  |
Note: Salary is measured in dollars per month and its value is < 10 ^5.

Answer:
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary) - AVG(REPLACE(Salary, '0', ''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;

Output: 2253

Explanation:
We can use REPLACE() function to solve the problem. The syntax is ‘REPLACE(str, from_str, to_str)’ and it returns the string str with all occurrences of the string from_str replaced by the string to_str.

actual average monthly salaries ==> AVG(Salary)
salary without zeros ==> REPLACE(Salary, ‘0’, ‘’)
miscalculated average monthly salaries ==> AVG(REPLACE(Salary, ‘0’, ‘’))
difference between actual and miscalculated average salaries ==>
SELECT AVG(Salary) - AVG(REPLACE(Salary, ‘0’, ‘’))
round the difference up to next integer ==> 
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary) - AVG(REPLACE(Salary, ‘0’, ‘’)))
from EMPLOYEES table ==> FROM EMPLOYEES
(The CEIL() function returns the smallest integer value that is bigger than or equal to a number.)
